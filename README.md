# dogcatclassifier
A dog and cat classifier that is trained on the 25,000 images of dogs and cats provided by Kaggle.

The 25,000 dataset that I have used to trained the model can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data

I have also uploaded a folder of sample test images that can be used to perform testing of this model. 

As for the kernel, I was not able to upload it due to its large image size, but I created a virtual enviornment and associated the kernel with it.
