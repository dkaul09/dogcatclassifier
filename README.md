# dogcatclassifier

<ins> **Project Descripition** </ins>
I built A dog and cat classifier, using on TensorFlow, that has been trained on the 25,000 images of dogs and cats provided by Kaggle. (The 25,000 dataset that I have used to trained the model can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data ) 


I have also uploaded a folder of sample test images that can be used to perform testing of this model. 

As for the kernel, I was not able to upload it due to its large image size, but I created a virtual enviornment and associated the kernel with it. 

<ins> **My Experience Building this project** </ins>




This is one of my first Machine Learning projects I have built. Having watched multiple Machine Learning tutorials during this summer, I decided to apply the concepts I have learnt through them into building a project. 




Overall, I enjoyed building this project as it was nice to see all the concepts that I have learned come to play, allowing me to understand their significance in machine learning projects. This was a great self-learning experience and has prompted me to work on a more sopshicated machine-learning project , a dog breed classifier.


<ins>** How does the project work?**</ins>



1. First, I imported all the required libraries.

2.  I then generate a dataset from the image files in the directory. Next, I call a batch of the images and as seen below there are pictures of both cats and dogs. The number 0 represents cats while 1 represents dogs.

3. I scale the images at this step by dividing the pixel values by 255. Scaling is important as it helps improve the training model's performance and normalizes the range of data.

4. Below I am establishing the size of the training data, validation data, and testing data as 0.7,0.2,0.1 respectively.

At first, this project seemed intimidating to me as I had so many questions to answer. How many images am I supposed to train my model on? How many epochs and batches am I supposed to use when training my model? How can I avoid overfitting? 

However, researching my doubts and testing different solutions allowed me gave me more confidence as I will able 

For instance, I did not know how many
