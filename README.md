# dogcatclassifier

<ins> **Project Descripition** </ins>
I built A dog and cat classifier, using on TensorFlow, that has been trained on the 25,000 images of dogs and cats provided by Kaggle. (The 25,000 dataset that I have used to trained the model can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data ) 


I have also uploaded a folder of sample test images that can be used to perform testing of this model. 

As for the kernel, I was not able to upload it due to its large image size, but I created a virtual enviornment and associated the kernel with it. 

<ins> ** My Experience Building this project ** </ins>

This is one of my first Machine Learning projects I have built. Having watched multiple Machine Learning tutorials during this summer, I decided to apply the concepts I have learnt through them into building a project. 

At first, this project seemed intimidating to me as I had so many questions to answer. How many images am I supposed to train my model on? How many epochs and batches am I supposed to use when training my model? How can I avoid overfitting? 






Overall, I enjoyed building this project as it was nice to see all the concepts that I have learned come to play, allowing me to understand their significance in machine learning projects. This was a great self-learning experience and has prompted me to work on a more sopshicated machine-learning project , a dog breed classifier.
