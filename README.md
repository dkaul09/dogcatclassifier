I built A dog and cat classifier, using on TensorFlow, that has been trained on the 25,000 images of dogs and cats provided by Kaggle. (The 25,000 dataset that I have used to trained the model can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data )

This is one of my first Machine Learning projects I have built. Having watched multiple Machine Learning tutorials during this summer, I decided to apply the concepts I have learnt through them into building a project. 

Initially,
